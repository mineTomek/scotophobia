              Coping with scotophobia can involve therapy, relaxation

              Causes of Scotophobia
            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Scotophobia can stem from traumatic experiences, such as being
              left alone in the dark as a child. It may also be linked to an
              overactive imagination or a fear of the unknown. In some cases, it
              can be a learned behavior from observing others with similar
              fears.

              <li>
                The word "scotophobia" comes from the Greek word "skotos,"
                meaning darkness.
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Many people with scotophobia find comfort in nightlights or
                sleeping with a light on.
              </li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">When to Seek Help</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              If scotophobia significantly impacts your daily life,
              relationships, or ability to function, it may be time to seek
              professional help. Therapists can provide strategies to manage and
              overcome the fear, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or
              exposure therapy.
